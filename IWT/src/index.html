    <div>The Hogwarts Library is a companion book collection first introduced to the world in March 2001, originally only consist of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, with J. K. Rowling
         authored under the pseudonyms Newt Scamander and Kennilworthy Whisp respectively, meaning to be copies of the in-universe books.The Hogwarts Library was located off of a corridor on the first-floor of Hogwarts Castle
          and contained tens of thousands of books on thousands of shelves. Overseen by Madam Irma Pince, the library was where students could go to peruse or borrow books to supplement their studies (or for personal enjoyment)
          Quite strict where the rules in the library was concerned, Madam Pince was the kind of librarian who saw herself as the guardian and protector of the books, at odds with the students who try to use them, whom she did not
           allow to eat, talk, laugh, whisper, sneeze or scurry in the library.[4] Overall, her demeanour did not suggest that she would be very helpful, as making research was very difficult in the Hogwarts library. As a result, 
           completing homework assignments that required additional information became unnecessarily tedious. As with a helpful librarian, students would not have to spend hours simply looking for the books they needed, but using 
           the information that could have been found quickly in the their homework, leaving less time for studying.</div>
